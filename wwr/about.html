                <p>Splash is more than just a water rafting company ‚Äî we‚Äôre a community of adventure-seekers, nature
                    lovers, and thrill enthusiasts. Our purpose is to create unforgettable, safe, and exhilarating
                    rafting experiences for people of all ages and skill levels.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="flex">
                <p>Splash was founded in 2018 by a group of passionate adventurers who believed that life is best
                    experienced on the water. What started as a small weekend rafting meetup along local rivers soon
                    grew into a full-fledged adventure company, offering guided rafting trips to thrill-seekers,
                    families, and nature lovers.

                    Driven by a love for the outdoors and a commitment to safety, Splash quickly became known for its
                    friendly guides, unforgettable experiences, and deep respect for nature. Over the years, we‚Äôve
                    expanded our routes, upgraded our equipment, and built a vibrant community of people who share our
                    love for adventure.

                    Today, Splash stands as one of the region‚Äôs most trusted water rafting companies, offering exciting
                    trips for beginners and seasoned rafters alike. And while we‚Äôve grown, our mission remains the same:
                    to help people ride the waves and live the adventure.</p>

                <p>
                    As Splash matured, we realized our journey was about more than rafting‚Äîit was about forging
                    unforgettable connections between people and the wild. In 2020, we introduced eco-rafting tours,
                    combining thrilling river rides with hands-on environmental education. This initiative inspired
                    countless guests to become stewards of nature. That same year, we opened our first training center,
                    equipping aspiring guides with essential skills and safety certifications. By 2022, Splash had built
                    partnerships with local schools, offering youth programs that foster courage, teamwork, and
                    environmental responsibility.

                    We also expanded into multi-day adventures, allowing guests to camp under the stars, cook over open
                    flames, and experience rivers like never before. Each milestone reflected our evolving vision: to
                    blend excitement with purpose. Through community outreach, sustainability efforts, and unforgettable
                    memories shared on the water, Splash evolved from a rafting provider into a lifestyle brand.

                    Today, Splash isn‚Äôt just about the ride‚Äîit‚Äôs about the journey, the people, and the promise of
                    discovery around every bend of the river.
