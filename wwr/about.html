            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Splash was founded in 2018 by a group of passionate adventurers who believed that life is best experienced on the water. What started as a small weekend rafting meetup along local rivers soon grew into a full-fledged adventure company, offering guided rafting trips to thrill-seekers, families, and nature lovers.

            Driven by a love for the outdoors and a commitment to safety, Splash quickly became known for its friendly guides, unforgettable experiences, and deep respect for nature. Over the years, we’ve expanded our routes, upgraded our equipment, and built a vibrant community of people who share our love for adventure.

            Today, Splash stands as one of the region’s most trusted water rafting companies, offering exciting trips for beginners and seasoned rafters alike. And while we’ve grown, our mission remains the same: to help people ride the waves and live the adventure.</p>
